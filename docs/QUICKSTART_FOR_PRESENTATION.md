# Quick Start Guide for Mid-Semester Presentation
## Tonight & Tomorrow Morning Checklist

---

## TONIGHT (Pre-Presentation Preparation)

### Step 1: Install Missing Dependencies (5 minutes)

```bash
cd "/Users/vaishnavikamdi/Documents/GWU/Classes/Fall 2025/AdvML/Spatio-Temporal_Traffic_Flow_Prediction"

# Install all required packages
pip install matplotlib seaborn tqdm h5py
```

### Step 2: Run Data Exploration Notebook (20 minutes)

**Option A: Using Jupyter Lab (Recommended)**
```bash
# Start Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab

# Navigate to: notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb
# Run all cells (Cell → Run All)
# This will generate all visualization images in the docs/ folder
```

**Option B: Using Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

# Open: notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb
# Run all cells
```

**Expected Outputs:**
- `docs/temporal_patterns.png` - Hourly and daily traffic patterns
- `docs/adjacency_matrix.png` - Spatial network structure
- `docs/spatial_correlation.png` - Correlation heatmap
- `docs/speed_distribution.png` - Speed histograms
- `docs/time_series_sample.png` - Sample sensor time series

**Time estimate:** 10-15 minutes to execute all cells

---

### Step 3: Run DCRNN Training Script (30 minutes)

```bash
# Run the minimal training script (smoke test)
python scripts/train_dcrnn_minimal.py
```

**What this does:**
- Loads subset of PEMS-BAY data (50 sensors, 7 days)
- Trains DCRNN for 10 epochs
- Evaluates on test set
- Generates prediction visualizations

**Expected Outputs:**
- `docs/training_loss.png` - Training/validation loss curves
- `docs/prediction_vs_truth.png` - Sample predictions vs ground truth
- `docs/error_distribution.png` - Error histogram

**Console Output:**
```
DCRNN MINIMAL TRAINING - SMOKE TEST
====================================
[STEP 1] Loading PEMS-BAY data...
[STEP 2] Normalizing data...
[STEP 3] Creating sequences...
[STEP 4] Splitting data...
[STEP 5] Initializing DCRNN model...
[STEP 6] Training model...
Epoch [ 1/10] | Train Loss: 0.XXXX | Val Loss: 0.XXXX
...
[STEP 7] Evaluating on test set...
  - Test MAE: X.XX mph
  - Test RMSE: X.XX mph
[STEP 8] Generating visualizations...
====================================
```

**Time estimate:** 10-20 minutes depending on your machine

### Step 4: Create PowerPoint Presentation (60-90 minutes)

**Use the structure in:** `docs/presentation_structure.md`

**Required Slides (7-10 total):**
1. Title Slide
2. Problem Statement & Motivation
3. DCRNN Architecture
4. Dataset Overview
5. Temporal Analysis (use `temporal_patterns.png`)
6. Spatial Analysis (use `adjacency_matrix.png`, `spatial_correlation.png`)
7. Implementation Progress (use `training_loss.png`)
8. Sample Predictions (use `prediction_vs_truth.png`)
9. Next Steps & Timeline
10. Summary & Questions

**Insert these images into your PPT:**
- All PNG files from `docs/` folder
- Make sure they're high resolution (already saved at 300 DPI)

---

### Step 5: Practice Presentation (30 minutes)

**Run through 3 times:**
1. First run: Get familiar with flow
2. Second run: Time yourself (should be ~8-9 minutes)
3. Third run: Practice transitions and explanations

**Key talking points to memorize:**
- MAE and RMSE values from your training
- Why DCRNN (spatial + temporal)
- Dataset size (325 sensors, 52,116 timesteps, 6 months)
- Input/output sequence lengths (12 steps each = 1 hour)

---

## TOMORROW MORNING (Pre-Presentation)

### 30 Minutes Before Class

**Final Checklist:**
- [ ] Laptop fully charged
- [ ] PPT presentation open and ready
- [ ] Backup: USB drive with presentation
- [ ] Backup: Email yourself the PPT
- [ ] Have Jupyter notebook open (in case professor wants to see code)
- [ ] Have training script ready to show
- [ ] Water bottle (stay hydrated!)

**Quick Review:**
- Look at your visualizations
- Review the key numbers (MAE, RMSE, dataset stats)
- Breathe and relax - you've done the work!

---

## DURING PRESENTATION

### Demo Options (If Time Permits or Asked)

**Option 1: Show Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
# Already have it running
jupyter lab

# Navigate to: notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb
# Show key visualizations and statistics
```

**Option 2: Show Training Script**
```bash
# Open in text editor to show code structure
open scripts/train_dcrnn_minimal.py

# Or show model architecture
open models/dcrnn.py
```

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Jupyter won't start
**Solution:**
```bash
# Install/reinstall jupyter
pip install --upgrade jupyter jupyterlab

# Or use classic notebook
jupyter notebook
```

### Issue: Training script crashes
**Solution:**
- Already have generated visualizations
- Show those in PPT
- Explain what the script does conceptually

### Issue: Import errors (torch_geometric, etc.)
**Solution:**
- For presentation, you don't NEED to run code live
- Focus on showing generated visualizations
- Explain methodology conceptually

### Issue: Out of memory during training
**Solution:**
- Reduce `USE_SENSORS` to 25 (line 44 in train_dcrnn_minimal.py)
- Reduce `USE_DAYS` to 3 (line 45)
- Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` to 2 (line 53)

- ✓ Real data (PEMS-BAY benchmark dataset)
- ✓ Working code (complete pipeline)
- ✓ Real results (trained model with metrics)
- ✓ Beautiful visualizations
- ✓ Clear next steps
- ✓ Solid understanding of methodology

**You're Ahead of:**
- Most classmates who might only have theory
- Projects with no implementation yet
- Projects with no real data analysis

**Professor Wants to See:**
1. You understand the problem
2. You have data and know it well
3. You've made concrete progress (not just plans)
4. You have a realistic path forward
5. You can explain your approach

**You have ALL of this!**

## POST-PRESENTATION (If Feedback Received)

**Take Notes On:**
- Suggested improvements
- Questions you couldn't answer
- Additional baselines to compare
- Evaluation metrics to add

**Follow Up:**
- Email professor thanking them
- Ask for clarification on any feedback
- Update project plan based on suggestions

## EMERGENCY CONTACT

If something goes wrong tonight:

**Jupyter Issues:**
- Google: "jupyter lab not starting mac"
- Stack Overflow is your friend
- Worst case: use Google Colab

**Code Issues:**
- Check error messages carefully
- Google the specific error
- Comment out problematic sections if needed

**Presentation Issues:**
- Keep it simple
- Focus on what works
- Be honest about challenges

---

**You've got this! The preparation is done, now it's time to shine!**

**Remember:** Confidence comes from preparation, and you've prepared well.

## OPTIONAL: Generate Example Stats (If Nervous)

Run this quick Python script to get your exact numbers:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv('data/PEMS-BAY.csv')
speed_data = df.iloc[:, 1:]

print("DATASET STATS FOR PRESENTATION:")
print(f"Number of sensors: {speed_data.shape[1]}")
print(f"Number of timesteps: {speed_data.shape[0]}")
print(f"Mean speed: {speed_data.values.mean():.2f} mph")
print(f"Std speed: {speed_data.values.std():.2f} mph")
print(f"Missing values: {speed_data.isna().sum().sum()}")
```

Save these numbers and use them in your presentation!
